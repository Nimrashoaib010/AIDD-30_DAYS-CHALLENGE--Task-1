1- What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?
A- AI Driven Development Using Artificial Intelligence tools into the 
   help of processing building softwares. Instead of manually doing 
   everything then write a code faster, fixing the bugs automatically, make 
   more creative ideas or designs, improves the mistakes. 

   It doesn't to replace the developer, but it support them to making the 
   development processs smarter, faster and more efficient.

2- How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?
A- I believe the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development will 
   be very balanced and meaningful. AI will definitely make our work faster by writing
   code, catching bugs, and giving smart suggestions, but the creative direction will
   still come from humans. Developers will guide the AI, make important decisions,
   and design solutions based on real user needs.
   In the future, working with AI will feel like working with a supportive teammate
   — one who helps with speed and accuracy, while humans handle logic, creativity, 
   and understanding. This partnership will make software development more efficient 
   and enjoyable.
